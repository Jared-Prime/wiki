I enjoy learning broadly and deeply. I study algebra, logic, philosophy of language, and some statistics. I want to be a better geometer. I read voraciously in 20th century modernist and post-modernist fiction, especially Aira, Borges, Bolano, Calvino, Carrington, Dos Passos, Herrera, Lipspector, Ocampo. I work in software ( the industry provides a casual composition of my mathematical and magical realist / surrealist interests ), and I examine programming language semantics and data architecture patterns. I am acquainted with economics, although I wouldn't take that further than invest in a moderate-risk, long-term portfolios. I do not understand European history very well; Asian, African, and South American histories simply aren't taught in the United States, so I have limited knowledge but would love to learn more.
