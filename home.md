# Welcome
This is my personal wiki. I write using the fantastic [wiki.js.org](https://wiki.js.org) and archive my entries on [github](https://github.com/Jared-Prime/wiki). I am glad you're reading!

## Inspiration

I began working with ZeroMQ recently (late October 2017). The software's guides were so well-written, I looked up the author, Pieter Hintjens, and began reading some of his other writings. This search led me to [Social Architecture](https://www.gitbook.com/book/hintjens/social-architecture/details). Soon, just as I had been inspired to implement as many ZeroMQ patterns as possible, I was inspired to follow through on some of the social patterns Hintjens proposed. A wiki seemed to be a good way to start.
